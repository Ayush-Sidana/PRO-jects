# Project Name

Design and Implementation of Distributed Compressive Video Sensing (DCVS) for
enhanced Video Transmission and Reconstruction.



## Project Overview

The Project is oriented around the video transmission and reconstruction. There are vari- ous algorithms to do so such as MPEG-2/4 and h.26x adopt the ideas of nonlinear com- pression and linear decompression, which bring great pressure to the encoding end . So, Distributed video Coding (DVC) was introduced which has good noise immunity and low coding complexity. to further improve the reconstruction of the video at the decoding side Compressed Sensing(CS) algorithm is combined to DVC which forms Distributed Compressive Video Sensing (DCVS) system. In CS algorithm the concept of Sparse Ma- trix which means the sparse original signal can be reconstructed from low-dimensional observations.Due to the similarity redundancy of the video frames, video image data can be regarded as sparse signals, which theoretically provides the possibility of entirely re- factoring from the compressed value.
We will study DCVS and the the Algorithms used to Recognize the Video Sequence at the receiver.
• We first introduce the BM3D-AMP into DCVS system for key frames reconstruction.
• We propose the new HEVC-ME algorithm with motion vector (MV) prediction method to improve the accuracy of side information.
• Based on l1 l1 minimization, we propose a new NK frames reconstruction model, which realize the dynamic reliance on information.

## Features


-This is the MATLAB Simulation Code of the BM3D part for zreconstruction of K-frames at the Decoding end.
